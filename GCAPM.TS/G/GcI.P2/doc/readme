Module-name: Gmatrix

General:  Computes G matrix, where G=ZXDX'Z', here X is an nxp matrix of covariates, D a diagonal matrix
          that can include weights (see below for further details) and Z is a matrix linking phenotypes with covariates.

Use: 
 To execute the module:
	=> Generate a copy of the module to a data-analysis folder
	=> Open R
	=> Set the working  to be the folder code within the data-analysis folder
	=> Modify the parameter file in the input folder.
	=> Type in the R-console:  source('mainCode.R')
	=> Results will be saved in the output folder.

Requires: 

Inputs:
    => (X): A comma sepparated ASCII file individuals in rows and covariates in columns. 
       First row of the file gives variable name, and 1s column gives individual IDs.
    => (weights):   a text file giving weights to be used in D (if NULL all covariates are equally weigthted)
    => (IDs of phenotypes): an ASCII files containing IDs of phenotypes, this is used to form Z
Output:
    => G.rda      G matrix in binary format.
    => SVD.rda    The eigen-value decomposition of G (computed using eigen(G)) 
    => Eigen.pdf  Plots of loadings of lines in the 1st eigenvectors, and of
                  the eigen-values, and of the cumulative variance explained 
                  by each component.
