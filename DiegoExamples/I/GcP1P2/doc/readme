Use: 
 To execute the module:
	=> Generate a copy of the module to a data-analysis folder
	=> Open R
	=> Set the working  to be the folder code within the data-analysis folder
	=> Modify the parameter file in the input folder.
	=> Type in the R-console:  source('mainCode.R')
	=> Results will be saved in the output folder.

Requires: 

Inputs:
    => G?.rda  Two matrices that will consider as interaction components. 
Output:
    => G??.rda      G matrix in binary format. Where ? is refered to components in interaction, i.e GE 
              (genotype by environment interaction)
    => SVD??.rda    The eigen-value decomposition of G (computed using eigen(G)) 
    => Eigen??.pdf  Plots of loadings of lines in the 1st eigenvectors, and of
                    the eigen-values, and of the cumulative variance explained 
                    by each component.
